This is a `format' control string that by default should contain three
`%s' conversion specifications: the first will be replaced by the
value of xsl-process-input-file \(or the empty string, if nil\); the
second will be replaced by xsl-process-stylesheet-file \(or the empty
string, if nil\); the third will be replaced by
xsl-process-output-file \(or the empty string, if nil\).

If `xsl-process-files' is non-nil, the format string should contain
one `%s' conversion specification for each element of its result.

If xsl-process-command is a list, then every element should be a
string.  The strings will be tried in order and %-sequences in the
string will be replaced according to the list below, if the string contains
%-sequences with no replacement value the next string will be tried.

%b means the visited file of the current buffer
%i means the value of xsl-process-input-file
%s means the value of xsl-process-stylesheet-file
%o means the value of xsl-process-output-file

several XSLT processors using those values.  Use M-p and M-n to step
